# Pistiii-s-Airsoft-Bomb
An airsoft bomb made by me :D

I created this airsoft bomb because at the field where I play their airsoft bomb is non functional for over a year.
I tried to find a bomb already done on the internet, but unfortunately I had to pay for the code, so I decided to make my own and make it free.
I kindly ask you to not sell my work if you hadn't modified it in any significant way.
If you do modify it in such a way that you can sell it (for example: added new gamemodes, drastically changing the code so it runs more efficiently, etc),
please refer me as the starter of this project.

Again, my whole point of publishing this is so it reaches as many players for free, I do not need money/donations from this project.
If you decide to make this airsoft bomb please share your progress with me or if you need help you can find me on reddit as u/Crays7, I will try to be as responsive as I can.

I have also uploaded all the libraries you need, those are not mine and I do not take any credit from them.
You also have a list with the components used.

Enjoy! :D
