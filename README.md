# Pistiii-s-Airsoft-Bomb
An airsoft bomb made by me :D

I created this airsoft bomb because at the field where I play their airsoft bomb is non functional for over a year.
I tried to find a bomb already done on the internet, but unfortunately I had to pay for the code, so I decided to make my own and make it free.

Currently I have made only 2 gamemodes: coalition and domination.

Coalition: 
Is a gamemode where one team plants the bomb by using any 4 digit password (recommended, do not create a password that starts with 0). After it is armed, the timer will start ticking and 
in the middle will be displayed the password  used to arm it and 3 random generated 4 digit passwords. When the wrong password is tried if it matche sone of the 3 fake ones, it will dissapear, the time will be halved and 
you will have 2 more times, fail one more time and the time will be halved again and the time will pass 5 times faster than usual. Fail one more time and the bomb "Explodes".
If you use the correct password you will be greeted by the sweet message "Bomb has been diffused".

Domination:
When the game starts the timer will start going down, I have used a 3 state switch for this gamemode, if you flip it in one way it will add time to the red team, if you flip it the other way
it will add time for the blue team, if it is in the middle it doesn't add time to neither team. when the timer reaches 0, it compares the times of both teams and declares the winning one.

I kindly ask you to not sell my work if you hadn't modified it in any significant way.
If you do modify it in such a way that you can sell it (for example: added new gamemodes, drastically changing the code so it runs more efficiently, etc),
please refer me as the starter of this project.

Again, my whole point of publishing this is so it reaches as many players for free, I do not need money/donations from this project.
If you decide to make this airsoft bomb please share your progress with me or if you need help you can find me on reddit as u/Crays7, I will try to be as responsive as I can.

I have also uploaded all the libraries you need, those are not mine and I do not take any credit from them.
Here you can find the documentation for the lcd used by me: https://github.com/gitcnd/LCDWIKI_GUI/blob/master/Document/LCDWIKI%20GUI%20lib%20Manual.pdf
You also have a list with the components used.

Enjoy! :D
